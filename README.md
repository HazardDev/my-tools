# Developer Tools

## [Visual Studio Code - Free](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Description

Visual Studio Code is an electron-based text editor written in TypeScript and intended for TypeScript development. It has support for TSLint and ESLint out of the box, and is very heavily geared towards modern development with extensions for every need. Extensions can be anything from special coloring of brackets, themes, or entire languages with debug support (see Java extension from RedHat). It has built-in git tools and a diff editor. Debugging is written to be simple and supports many languages. The C++ debugger is quite good. 

### Features
